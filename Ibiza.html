        <h1><strong>Travel to Ibiza</strong></h1>
        <p>Ibiza is a rock island covering an area of 572.56 square kilometres (221.07 sq mi), almost <strong><em>six times</em></strong> smaller than Majorca, but over five times larger than Mykonos (in the Greek Isles) or <strong>10 times</strong> larger than Manhattan in New York City.</p>

        <p>It is one of the most famous, scenic and popular of the Balearic Islands. Although the island’s size is relatively small, it is packed with attractions and things to do. Ibiza is widely known for its unparalleled nightlife, but there is also plenty to experience during the day. From the history of Ibiza Town to the sandy beaches of Cala Llenya, Ibiza is an island that is well worth a visit.</p>
        
        <p>Here is a list of <strong>most popular</strong> places in Ibiza</p>
        <ul id="most-popular">

            <li>Playa d'en Bossa</li>
            <li>Santa Eulalia del Rio</li>

            <li>Ibiza Town</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here are the 3 <strong><em>must</em></strong> visit places in Ibiza</p>
        <ol id="must">
            <li>Es Vedra</li>
            <li>Portinatx</li>
            <li>Ibiza Town</li>
        </ol>


        <h2>Cala Llenya</h2>
        <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Cala_de_la_Llenya.jpg' alt = 'cala llenya beach' width ='500'>
        <p class="beach">The beach is just 10 minutes away from San Carlos, and it is on the smaller side. That means smaller crowds, as well. Instead of offering walking access to dozens of nightlife venues, Cala Llenya is surrounded by lush green pine trees. <em>Beach volleyball</em> is popular at this beach, and many families gravitate toward the more relaxed atmosphere in the area. If you’re around on a Sunday, check out the weekly <strong>Cala LLenya markets</strong> just before you head to the beach.</p>
        <h2>Playa d'en Bossa</h2>
        <img src='https://solycoco.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Playa-den-Bossa-Ibiza_00005.jpg' alt = "Playa d'en Bossa beach" width ='500'>
        <p class="beach">This coastal resort spot is incredibly appealing for those who want an all-inclusive holiday right on the beach. It's also the <strong>longest beach</strong> on the island, which means you won’t have any trouble securing a daybed or a lounger right on the sand. <em>If you’re coming to Ibiza for the nightlife, then Playa d’en Bossa is ideal</em>. There are plenty of late-night bars and clubs in the area, some of which are right on the sand.</p>
        
        <h2>Santa Eulalia del Rio</h2>
        <img src='https://a.travel-assets.com/findyours-php/viewfinder/images/res70/245000/245249-Ibiza-Island.jpg' alt = "Santa Eulalia del Rio promenade" width ='500'>
        <p> One of the main draws to Santa Eulalia del Rio is the long promenade that runs along the coast. Lined with palm trees, the promenade lets you walk next to the water and admire beach views for miles. The <strong>shopping</strong> and <strong>culinary options</strong> take precedence over nightlife at this coastal destination.</p>
        
        <h2>Cala Llonga</h2>
        <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Cala_Llonga_de_Cala_d%27Or.JPG' alt = "Cala Llonga port" width ='500'>
        <p class="beach"> This is perhaps the most family-oriented place to visit in Ibiza, which means that you’ll find plenty of families with young children in the area. The main beach even offers a <strong>playground and a miniature amusement park</strong> to keep kids having fun throughout the vacation. Cala Llonga is also situated just 10 minutes from Ibiza Town, which means you can easily head away from the beach and explore the historic attractions any time.</p>
        
        <h2>Es Vedra</h2>
        <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Es_Vedr%C3%A1_%28Eivissa%29.jpg' alt = "Es Vedra island of mountains" width ='500'>
        <p class="rock">One of the <em>most intriguing destinations</em> in Ibiza is the island of Es Vedra. Located just off the coast of Cala d’Hort on the western coast, Es Vedra is completely uninhabited. However, it is steeped in mystery and lore. Legends tie Es Vedra to Tanit, the Phoenician lunar goddess. The island was also the spot where the infamous sirens tried to lure Odysseus from his ship in Homer’s Odyssey. <strong>It is said that Es Vedra is incredibly magnetic, behind only the North Pole and the Bermuda Triangle</strong>. Cruises take you to see Es Vedra up close, plus they offer amazing views of the surrounding landscape.</p>
        
        <h2>Portinatx</h2>
        <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/EIVISSA_03_%281590085949%29.jpg' alt = "Portinatx clear beach with families" width ='500'>
        <p class="beach">Portinatx is very popular with snorkelers and divers thanks to its clear waters. It is a great <strong>family spot</strong>, and it is the ideal place to begin longer <strong>coastal walks</strong>. Best of all, most hotels in the area are within a short walk of at least one of the three main beaches.</p>
        
        <h2>Ibiza Town</h2>
        <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/ForbysIbizaTown_03.jpg/800px-ForbysIbizaTown_03.jpg' alt = "Ibiza Town view" width ='500'>
        <p>The port city known as Ibiza Town is the <em>largest</em> and <em>pretiest</em> destination on the island. Overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, Ibiza Town boasts a walled fortress as well as cobblestone streets. Locals call the city <strong>Eivissa</strong>. Ibiza Town is divided into sections: <strong>Dalt Vila</strong> and <strong>Eixample</strong>. Perched above the water, Dalt Vila, or Old Town, is the historic area filled with world-class restaurants and a great selection of bars. Below, you’ll find Eixample, or Extension, where most of the newer buildings can be found. While visiting, be sure to check out the Cathedral called <strong><em>Our Lady of the Snows</em></strong>, which offers perhaps the best views in the entire town.</p>
